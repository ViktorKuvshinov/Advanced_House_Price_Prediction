What has been done:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Models training: Lasso, XGboost, LGBM, Catboost,
- Hyperparameters tuning with a help of Optuna
- Feature analysis with a 'Feature importances' and 'Permutation importances'
- Best result was achieved with a blending model: __103__ place out of __4239__ with a RMSLE metric __0.11755__
